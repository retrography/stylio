# Stylio

Import formatted citation data into Zotero using AnyStyle.io!

Installation:

1. Clone this repo (or download it as a zip file)
2. Get an API Key from AnyStyle.io and save it in a file called `api.key` at the root of your clone directory
3. Run `pack.sh`
4. Install the resulting `xpi` add-on manually in Firefox (or Zotero standalone)

After restarting FireFox you will get a menu item labelled __Import From Clipboard (Formatted)__ under Zotero's Actions menu (the gear icon). 

___Note:___ _This is not a signed extension -- yet. You need to [enable unsigned extensions](http://www.thewindowsclub.com/allow-unsigned-extensions-installed-firefox) in Firefox before installing it._
